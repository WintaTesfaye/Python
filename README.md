## Definitions
> An expression in programming is a piece of code that produces value.

> In programming Syntax means grammer. So SyntaxError means Grammer Error.

> Python Enhancement Proposals aka [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)

> The programming languages we use like C, C#, Java, Python these are all simple text based languages that we humans understand. Computers don't understand them, they only understand Machine Code. So if you have some code written in C you should convert it into Machine Code. That's the job of a C `Compiler`. So a C Compiler is a program that knows how to convert or compile C code into Machine Code. 

> Machine Code is specific to the type of CPU of a computer. If you compile a C program on a Windows Machine you can't execute it on a mac, because Windows and Mac have different Machine Codes just like people from different countries speak different languages.

> Java came to solve this problem. The Java Compiler doesn't compile Java code into Machine Code instead it compiles it into portible language called Java Bytecode. It is not specific to a hardware platform like Windows or Mac.

> To convert Java Bytecode into Machine Code we use Java Virtual Machine [JVM]. When we run a Java program JVM kicks in it loads our Java Bytecode at run time and converts each instruction to Machine Code. (These can only happen if you have a JVM running on your platform.) There are JVM implants for Windows, Mac, and so on. So the JVM implmintations on Window knows how to convert Jave Bytecode into Machine Code that a Windows Machine Code can understand.

> C# and Python also take in the same route so their platform independent, meaning it doesn't matter what platform you're  running it on.

> When a Python program is ran using CPython, first it will compile Python code into Python Bytecode then it will pass that Bytecode to Python virtual Machine aka [PVM] to Machine Code.
